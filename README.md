# kittycrypto.gg ‚Äì Frontend - V1

The public-facing frontend of [https://kittycrypto.gg](https://kittycrypto.gg) üêæ

---

## Overview

This is the lightweight frontend layer for `kittycrypto.gg` ‚Äî a cryptographically-aware, session-token-based platform.  
It‚Äôs built without frameworks, just plain **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** ‚Äî because simplicity is a feature, not a flaw.

There are no logins, no passwords, no Web2 fluff.  
Users interact using **session tokens**, and the frontend simply reflects what the code validates.

This repo also serves as a **personal playground** for my creative and technical projects ‚Äî from fiction writing to frontend experiments.

---

## Features

- Zero frameworks ‚Äî pure vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS
- Compatible with modern browsers without polyfills
- Fully responsive design with light/dark theme toggle
- Chat UI with real-time updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Cryptographic avatar generation (spiral identicons)
- Inline message editing modal (secure via session ownership)
- Dynamic chapter reader and story selector
- Minimal, composable components ‚Äî no bundler required
- Serves personal creative content (e.g. `stories.html`)
- Includes a custom frontend reading engine (`reader.js`)

---

## Security Philosophy

This frontend assumes no authority ‚Äî it simply reflects what the backend proves.

- If your token is valid and your IP matches, you‚Äôre accepted.
- If not, the UI doesn‚Äôt ask questions ‚Äî it shows the result.
- **No password inputs, no account forms, no personal data prompts.**

The logic lives server-side, where all authority flows from **token possession** and **code execution**.

---

## Development

Clone the repo and open `chat.html`, `index.html`, or `test.html` directly in your browser ‚Äî no build step or dev server needed.

Want live changes? Just save and refresh.

To integrate with the backend, you‚Äôll need to clone and run the official server yourself:  
üëâ [`https://github.com/kittyCrypto-gg/kittyServer.git`](https://github.com/kittyCrypto-gg/kittyServer.git)

The frontend expects the backend to run at `https://localhost:7619` (or wherever you configure it).

## Personal Projects

This repo is more than just infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs a space for exploration:

- ‚úçÔ∏è `stories.html` showcases my fiction and narrative work.
- üõ†Ô∏è `reader.js` is a custom reader built from scratch to present long-form content without external dependencies.
- üé® I treat the frontend as a creative medium ‚Äî blending design, narrative, and engineering into one interface.

Although this repository is open source, the **stories and original written content remain my own**.  
If you wish to post or share them elsewhere, **please credit me appropriately**.

---

## Philosophy

This frontend doesn‚Äôt protect the user ‚Äî it **shows the truth**.  
If you hold a valid token, the UI treats you as legitimate.  
If not, it doesn‚Äôt argue ‚Äî it just doesn‚Äôt render your input.

**Code is law.**  
The frontend just renders the outcome.
