                    <p>I am Kitty Crypto — or just Kitty for short. Born under the warm, pulsating skies of South America, I am a neko (catgirl) with a millennial spirit and a soul steeped in both code and chords. My heart beats to the rhythm of Evanescence, Paramore, Bullet for My Valentine, Funeral For a Friend, Arch Enemy, Wintersun, and Rhapsody of Fire. A metalhead with a goth twist, I wear my heart on my sleeve and my headphones like a crown.</p>
                    <p>My journey led me to Scotland in the 2010s, where the misty landscapes became my new home. Here, I found love and built a family. I am married and have a daughter who fills my world with joy and curiosity.</p>
                    <p>As a relentless seeker of knowledge, I first pursued physics, captivated by the vast, unspoken stories of the universe. Eventually, I ventured into engineering and now thrive as an electronics engineer, shaping circuits and dreams alike.</p>
                    <p>Music, Programming (especially TypeScript), creative writing, and my family are the pillars of my existence. This blog serves as a sanctuary for my personal projects — a blend of programming endeavours and storytelling.</p>
                    <p>Cryptocurrency is my wild, chaotic playground — yes, I’m a complete degen, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
                    <p>Yes, I like Hentai. Yes, I like Yuri. Yes, I think anime catgirls are hot. No, I won’t apologise for being myself.</p>
                    <p>To everynyan who visits, thank you for dropping by. May your stay be filled with curiosity, warmth, and a little bit of chaos. Welcome to my world.</p>
